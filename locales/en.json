It guides those involved in cryptocurrency markets towards lawful earnings, free from any form of usury or prohibited gains. To achieve this goal, the Crypto Halal office for Sharia compliance and auditing was established in October 2021 by Dr. Mohamed Youssef Abu Jazar, an expert in comparative jurisprudence, particularly financial transactions, a member of the Islamic Economy Forum, the Palestine Scholars Association, and a Sharia judge in financial matters for 12 years.",
