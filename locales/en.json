    "whatIsCryptoDesc": "Crypto Halal is a comprehensive project aimed at creating a trading environment free from religious prohibitions, guiding participants in cryptocurrency markets toward halal earnings, free from usury or any form of forbidden gain. To achieve this goal, in October 2021, the Crypto Halal Office for Shariah Compliance and Auditing of cryptocurrency markets was established by Dr. Mohammed Youssef Abu Jazar, a specialist in comparative jurisprudence, particularly Islamic financial transactions. He is a member of the Islamic Economy Forum, the Palestine Scholars Association, and has served as a legal arbitrator in financial cases for (12) years.",
