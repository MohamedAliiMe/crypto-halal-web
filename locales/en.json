It guides traders in the cryptocurrency markets towards lawful earnings, free from interest or any other form of prohibited earnings. To achieve this goal, the Crypto Halal office for Sharia oversight and audit of cryptocurrency markets was established in October 2021 by Dr. Mohammad Yousif Abu Jazar, a specialist in comparative jurisprudence, particularly financial transactions jurisprudence. He is a member of the Islamic Economics Forum and the Association of Palestinian Scholars and has served as a Sharia arbitrator in financial cases for 12 years.",
